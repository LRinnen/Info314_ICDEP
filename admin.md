### How can we send commands ("SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE", etc) to individual nodes in the network, rather than treat them as pass-through intermediaries?

#### Send messages to all the nodes along the path:

We will include the command on the back side of the index card (not the side with the messages), in the bottom left corner. As each node recieves the card, they will see the command, pass the card to the next node and then follow the command.

#### Send a message to the nth node along the path:

We will include the command in the bottom left corner on the back of the card, followed by a number. The number represents the nth node that should recieve this command. As each node recieves the card, they will place a tally mark next to the number. Once the tally marks match the number, that current node will pass the card on and then follow the command. 

Nodes will only place a tally mark if the marks are still less than the number (after the nth node is reached, the nodes will not continue to create tallys).

#### Send a message to a particular node along the path:

We will include the command in the botton left corner on the back of the card, followed by the initials of the node that we are targeting. If the node's initials match the ones on the card, then they will pass the card along and then follow the command.

In the case that there are multiple nodes with the same initials, the first node that matches the initials will not destroy/cover the initials written on the card to ensure that any following nodes will also have the chance to follow the command as well.
