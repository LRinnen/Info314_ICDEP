### How can we add additional features to the protocol without breaking previous functionality?


#### Send to any individual on the whole UW campus

We will include the building name, room number, and the person's name above the message.

We will assign different runners to each building.
- There will be a runner for each floor of every building that will deal transferring messages within the same floor.
- There will be a runner for each in-between floors that will deal with transferring messages either up or down from their stationed floor.
- There will be a runner for each building that is next to the runner's current one that will deal with transferring messages to the next building that is closer to the end building destination.

In whole, if I want to send a message to Suzzallo Library floor one and I am in Odegard Library on floor two, then the message will go from my floor's runner, into the stair's runner, who will delier the message to the runner at the door. The runner at the door will give my message to the runner at Kane hall, who will deliever it to the runner at Ode. The runner at Ode will move the message to the runner on the first floor of Ode, who will then deliver the message to its destination room.

#### Specify whether contents are ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values

To keep this simple, we will include the type of the contents in the corner of the index card. So we will write ASCII, Unicode or binary on the card.

#### Keep a record of what nodes the card has passed through.

We will have each node write their initials on the back of the card (not the side with the message), starting from the top left. To ensure that there is space, each node will write their name in small print.
